*For traveling abroad highly highly recommend looking at other airports. These are from Detroit, but they are much cheaper out of Chicago and may be worth the drive/train there. Also, travel times abroad vary more due to layover and specific location so I chose not to include those here at the moment.

Every individual has different tastes and preferences, but here are a few ways I have been able to save during my travels to adhere to my budget and make traveling sustainable for me:

1. Try flying out of different airports. The cost of driving a little bit to another State close by or a different
airport not too far away can help save significant costs. From Ann Arbor, the Detroit airport DTW is good, but Toronto
(YYZ), Chicago (ORD), and other airports in Ohio are worth looking to fly from.

2. Finding the right amount of people to go with (whether friends or family), can make the trip more fun and can
decrease the cost per person for accommodation.
3. Travel at off-peak times and do research to pick the right time to book.

2. Monitor Google Flights as much as possible to get the best deals. Utilize the map function to find new places you
might not have considered at a price you are happy with. Also many social media sites, such as Scottâ€™s Cheap Flights on
Instagram do some of that research for you!

3. Do not go out for every meal while you are there. Try to plan your meals accordingly and bring snacks when you can.
It is important to enjoy but you can eat less for breakfast and enjoy later for brunch/lunch!

4. Get good at packing and pack light. I love bringing a ton of clothes I probably never will end of wearing when I
travel but I will never pay for another bag unless strictly necessary.

Overall these are just a few suggestions and what work for me may not work for other people. Hopefully this has been
inspiring and you can find out what works for you too.

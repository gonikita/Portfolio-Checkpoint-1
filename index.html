Hi, welcome to Travel Niki 101! This site is to help you get travel inspiration for the next time wanderlust hits you and you would like to go somewhere.

Where I Started -> Where I Want to Go
In terms of travel, I really have no idea where or when I started because I have an awful memory. I know I was incredibly fortunate to get to go many places with my family when I was younger and today as well. From the U.S. to Canada, to Europe, to India, and to Israel I have been lucky for all those journeys. I love to hike in nature amongst beautiful sights and I make sure to do something like that wherever I go. Next, I would love to go to Africa and go on a Safari to see the amazing wildlife. Later I want to go to New Zealand for an alpaca farm.

About Me
Hi, I am Niki. I am a junior at the University of Michigan studying business and information science. I am from Saginaw, MI and am currently residing in Ann Arbor for school. I love to bake and eat yummy desserts and am trying to love running (so I can burn off those cals). I like to be active and go on walks. I also enjoy playing sports, whether itâ€™s a low stakes intramural game or a game of tennis with my friends. I am excited to see where life takes me next and am happy to share my journey :)
